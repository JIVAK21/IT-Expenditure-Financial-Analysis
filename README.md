Provide actionable recommendations for cost control and revenue diversification.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

Revenue data (Sales, Consulting, Other income)

Expense breakdown (Payroll, Equipment, Marketing)

Opex ratios by month

Profitability ratios (Gross Margin, EBIT Margin, Net Profit Margin)

📊 Key Insights
1. Revenue & Profitability

Total Revenue: $17.6M

Net Profit: $4.3M

Net Profit Margin: ~24.5%

➡️ This shows the company converts nearly a quarter of its revenue into profit – a strong indicator of financial health.

2. Opex Ratio Analysis

Range: 25.7% (Jan) to 41.2% (Sep)

Conclusion: Some months are efficient, while others face high operational costs.

➡️ We need more consistency in controlling Opex to maintain profitability.

3. Monthly Opex Changes

Largest Increase: May (+18.7%)

Largest Decrease: March (-12.2%)

➡️ Unstable costs suggest one-time activities like hiring, equipment purchases, or campaigns. Smoother management is required.

4. Revenue Breakdown

Sales Revenue: $13.77M (78%)

Consulting Services: $2.81M (16%)

Other Income: $0.96M (6%)

➡️ Sales is the core driver. Consulting provides diversification but remains secondary.

5. Expense Breakdown

Payroll: $1.79M

Equipment: $1.33M

Marketing: $1.05M

➡️ Payroll and equipment are the biggest cost drivers. Marketing also requires close ROI tracking.

6. Key Ratios

Gross Margin: 63.3%

EBIT Margin: 29.8%

Net Profit Margin: 24.5%

➡️ Profitability is strong, but efficiency in Opex can push margins even higher.

✅ Overall Conclusion

The company is financially healthy and profitable.

Revenue streams are strong, mainly from sales.

Profit margins are healthy, but they fluctuate due to inconsistent Opex.
